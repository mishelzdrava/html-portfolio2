<h1>My favorite movies</h1>
<h2>The best four movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>La haine</h3>
<p>This beautiful french film, encaptures the struggles and consequences of poverty within the youth.<br/>
    The themes resonated with me deeply and the cinematography was gorgeous.</p>

<h3>Everything everwhere all at once</h3>
<p>A touching story with otherworldly creativity in it.</p>

<h3>Aftersun</h3>
<p>One of the best stories about love and depression, mixed together in a hazy, soft summer story.</p>
